## Hello! I'm Eduarda 😊
I'm an aspiring Software Developer with a passion for front-end development, particularly in creating interactive user experiences. I'm currently expanding my skillset in React and Angular through personal projects that align with my interests!

## ✨ My interests
- 📱 Tech: Mobile and web app development, UI/UX design, game design.
- 🎮 Creative Hobbies: I love gaming, reading (mostly fantasy and sci-fi!), and cosplaying my favourite characters. And drawing - though I’ve taken a break from it, it's still something I enjoy! 
- 🌏 Other interests: I’m currently learning Japanese in my free time, as it's one of my dreams to visit Japan. 🌸
- 🐱 Cats: I looove cats! And bubble tea. Are these two things related? Not really, but I adore both of them so they definitely deserve a spot here.

## 💻 Featured Projects
- **[Personal Website/Portfolio](https://github.com/eduarda-aires/cosplanner)**: A cozy little website I built for myself - inspired by soft, pastel themes! Used React, Tailwind CSS, Typescript and NextJS. Deployed via Vercel at https://aires-portfolio.vercel.app/.
- **[Cosplay Planner Web App](https://github.com/eduarda-aires/cosplanner)**: A personal project I developed in my spare time. A React-based app meant to help me manage one of my hobbies: planning and organizing cosplays, including features for tracking materials, deadlines, and sources of inspiration.
- **[Ruralia Mobile App](https://github.com/Betolas9/RURALIA-Final-Project)**: A mobile application developed as my University Final Project, using **Flutter**, with the goal of transforming rural tourism in Portugal into a more sustainable and engaging experience through gamification.
- **Purrfect Escape - Labyrinth Game**: A simple labyrinth-escape game created for my Computer Graphics course, where the user plays as a cat (of course it had to be a cat) navigating a maze to find and save other cats before escaping. Developed using JavaScript and basic 3D rendering techniques. [Play it here!](https://raw.githack.com/eduarda-aires/Purrfect-Escape/refs/heads/main/index.html)
- **Vulnerabilities in Software Products**: A web application developed in alignment with the **Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)**, which helps identify and mitigate common security vulnerabilities in software products. Built using **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the app includes features for: security assessment, reporting, and compliance tracking.
