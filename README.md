## Hello! I'm Aires 👋
I'm an aspiring Software Developer with a strong interest in front-end development, particularly in creating interactive user experiences using modern frameworks. I'm currently expanding my skillset in React and Angular through personal projects that align with my interests!

## 🎯 Interests
- 📱 Tech: Mobile and web app development, UI/UX design, game design.
- 🎮 Hobbies: I love gaming, reading (fantasy and sci-fi), and cosplaying characters from my favorite series!
- 🐱 Cats: I love cats!

## 🌟 Featured Projects
- **Cosplay Planner Web App:** A React-based app designed to help users plan and organize cosplays, including features for tracking materials, deadlines, and sources of inspiration.
- **Purrfect Escape - Labyrinth Game**: A simple labyrinth-escape game created for my Computer Graphics course, where the user plays as a cat navigating a maze to find and save other cats before escaping. Developed using JavaScript and basic 3D rendering techniques. [Play it here!](https://raw.githack.com/eduarda-aires/Purrfect-Escape/refs/heads/main/index.html)
- **[Ruralia Mobile App](https://github.com/Betolas9/RURALIA-Final-Project)**: A mobile application developed as my University Final Project, using **Flutter**, with the goal of transforming rural tourism in Portugal into a more sustainable and engaging experience through gamification.
- **Vulnerabilities in Software Products**: A web application developed in alignment with the **Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)**, which helps identify and mitigate common security vulnerabilities in software products. Built using **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the app includes features for security assessment, reporting, and compliance tracking. This project demonstrates my ability to build secure web applications while adhering to industry standards.
